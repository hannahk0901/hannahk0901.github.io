      <h3>Designer Statement</h3>
      <p>My visual argument, Digital Overload, critiques how social media has transformed
connection into consumption. It argues that users are not only constantly watched by digital
platforms, but also conditioned to seek validation through endless scrolling and notification
loops. The composition centers on a person illuminated by the harsh blue glow of a phone
screen. That glow represents both attraction and entrapment highlighting that addictive light that
keeps us staring even when we know it’s draining us. Surrounding the figure are scattered eyes,
symbols of surveillance, judgment, and others who are similarly addicted. Each one mirrors the
feeling of being observed online, even in supposed solitude. Behind it all, familiar icons from
Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms blur into a chaotic fog that erases individuality. One of
my biggest challenges was getting that chaos to feel intentional. My early drafts were too
cluttered as I had too many icons, too many eyes, and too much noise. The composition looked
overwhelming, but not in the purposeful way I wanted. The viewer didn’t know where to look,
and that confusion weakened the argument. What fixed it was how I reworked the light. I made
the phone and person the brightest point in the piece and darkened everything else around it as I
expanded outwards. That glow instantly draws the eye to the center and symbolizes how screens
dominate our focus. I also made the icons more transparent by lowering the opacity so that they
could be chaotic without overtaking the scene. Once I found that balance, the image felt
overwhelming but controlled.I chose a cold blue color palette to emphasize emotional
detachment. The layered opacity of icons and eyes creates visual noise that mirrors the constant
flood of notifications and content we face every day. The central figure’s exhaustion captures the
hidden emotional cost of our digital lives. Overall, making my piece made me think more
critically about design as communication. I realized that creating digital media isn’t just about
making something look polished, but it’s about directing emotion and attention.</p>
