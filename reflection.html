      ENGCMP 0610 — Composing Digital Media<br>
      December 2025</p>

      <p>Throughout this semester in <em>Composing Digital Media</em>, I have learned to see myself not only as a writer or a student, but as a digital composer who works across modalities, genres, and platforms. When I entered the course, I understood digital media mostly as the content I consumed—gaming trailers, social-media graphics, short-form videos, and the collage-like chaos of the internet. I did not yet understand the rhetorical labor behind it or the ways digital creators intentionally shape audience experience. Over the past several months, through the progression of Project 1, Project 2, and finally Project 3, I have developed a fuller understanding of digital rhetoric, multimodal composition, and my own evolving identity as a digital creator. My central claim is that this course taught me how to translate emotion into design: I learned how to move from analyzing hype, identity, and digital excess to creating work that intentionally communicates those themes. Across all three projects, I began experiencing media not as a passive viewer, but as someone who can look underneath a composition and understand how and why it persuades. That shift—from consumption to creation—is the most meaningful insight I will take away.</p>

      <h4>Metacognitive Journey Across Modalities</h4>

      <p>My metacognitive journey begins with Project 1, a rhetorical analysis of Riot Games’ <em>Born to Burn | Valorant Champions Paris Opening Tease</em>. Before this course, I had watched esports promotional videos hundreds of times without thinking about them rhetorically. I enjoyed the hype, the colors, the music, the emotions, but I had never asked myself why they were so persuasive. Project 1 forced me to become a close observer. I discovered that hype is not accidental; it is built through layers of visual rhetoric, emotional design, and careful storytelling. In the Valorant teaser, Riot uses the symbolic language of love—pain, sacrifice, devotion, renewal—to reframe competition as a passionate, almost romantic act. Recognizing that rhetorical strategy helped me understand how digital creators construct narratives that audiences feel rather than consciously analyze.</p>

      <p>Writing the analysis also helped me develop habits of attention that carried into my later projects. I learned to look for patterns in lighting, color palettes, pacing, translations, transitions, and emotional cues. I began connecting these findings to concepts from Carroll and McCloud. McCloud’s idea of closure helped me understand why the fast-cut sequences in the teaser felt so immersive: viewers subconsciously fill in the gaps between frames, creating emotional continuity. Carroll’s discussion of hierarchy and structure helped me see how the teaser arranged its emotional beats from loss, to revenge, to renewal, to unity. By breaking down the teaser’s choices, I saw how rhetorical meaning emerges through design, not just content.</p>

      <p>That understanding deeply influenced how I approached Project 2, my visual argument titled <em>Digital Overload</em>. If Project 1 taught me how to analyze digital media, Project 2 required me to create it—and that transition was transformative. I was no longer just evaluating design but producing it. I had to think about color, composition, focal point, balance, and emotional impact. I realized how easily visual arguments can become overwhelming when too many elements compete for attention. In my early drafts, the icons and eyes crowded the composition so heavily that the central figure almost disappeared. It took multiple attempts before I learned how to use lighting and opacity to create hierarchy—to direct the viewer’s gaze toward the moment of meaning.</p>

      <p>More importantly, I realized how powerful visual metaphor can be. My collage critiques how digital platforms consume our attention and turn users into performers constantly watched by algorithms and strangers. The blue glow on the subject symbolizes both attraction and exhaustion. The surrounding eyes serve as watchers—representing judgment, surveillance, and the pressure to perform. The fog of social-media icons symbolizes noise and overstimulation. Creating these metaphors required the same rhetorical awareness I practiced in Project 1, but in a new medium. I was no longer interpreting meaning but constructing it intentionally.</p>

      <p>By the time I reached Project 3—building my portfolio website—I had to combine everything I had learned: rhetorical analysis, emotional visual design, and now information architecture, interface design, and coding. Creating the portfolio forced me to think about audience, purpose, identity, and design philosophy at the level of the entire site. I wanted the portfolio to feel cohesive with the themes of my earlier projects—digital culture, hype, overstimulation, and self-awareness. I chose a dark, neon-accented aesthetic inspired by esports visuals because my intended audience was young adults who live deeply online. Smooth transitions and hover animations created a sense of playfulness and polish, while the simple navigation layout reflected Carroll’s emphasis on readability and hierarchy.</p>

      <h4>Articulation of Design Philosophy</h4>

      <p>My design philosophy emerged gradually as I built the site. I wanted every page to feel like part of the same digital world—unified by color, typography, and layout. The dark background reduces visual noise and references gaming interfaces. Neon cyan and magenta represent energy and intensity; they echo the visuals of my Valorant analysis and the emotional voltage of my collage. Orbitron, my display font, evokes futuristic esports branding, while Inter provides clean readability for long-form text.</p>

      <p>I also learned that design is rhetorical. Choices like spacing, alignment, and contrast all communicate meaning about identity. For example, centering content gives the site a dramatic, cinematic feeling, while wide margins improve readability. Adding hover animations and smooth scrolling communicates modernity and digital fluency. Matching the aesthetics of Project 1 and Project 2 created a sense of cohesion and ethos: the audience can see that I understand the visual language of digital culture and can deploy it intentionally.</p>

      <h4>Digital Media Tool Integration</h4>

      <p>This project required me to work critically with digital tools. I used HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages to construct the site itself, troubleshooting issues that only appeared after deployment. I learned to manage file paths, case sensitivity, responsive design, and cross-page consistency. Through this process, I developed technical literacy and confidence in problem-solving.</p>

      <p>I also used AI tools—specifically ChatGPT—for brainstorming, troubleshooting, and refining my writing. AI never generated my analysis or arguments; instead, it served as a companion for clarifying ideas, testing draft phrasing, and fixing technical bugs. Using AI responsibly required continuous reflection: I had to decide when suggestions were useful, when they weren’t, and whether they aligned with my goals. This class taught me to approach AI not as a shortcut but as a tool that must be used with transparency and intention.</p>

      <h4>Conclusion: Looking Forward</h4>

      <p>Looking ahead, the ethical dimension of digital creation feels increasingly important to me. This course made me realize how powerful and overwhelming digital media can be. It also showed me how meaningful it can be when used intentionally. As someone who grew up in digital spaces—gaming, social media, shared online culture—I now understand that I am not only shaped by digital media; I can shape it in return. This realization carries responsibility. Whether I create future projects in academic, professional, or personal contexts, I want to be conscious of clarity, accessibility, emotional impact, and honesty.</p>

      <p>The most meaningful insight I am taking away from this course is that digital composition is a form of emotional and rhetorical design. It is not just about creating content but about shaping experiences. Across Projects 1, 2, and 3, I learned to analyze, create, and integrate multimodal arguments that express who I am and how I understand digital culture. Most importantly, I discovered a new identity for myself: someone who can take the overwhelming intensity of digital life and turn it into meaningful, intentional, and reflective digital expression.</p>

      <h4>AI Use Statement</h4>
      <p>I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) throughout this project as a supplementary tool for brainstorming ideas, clarifying sentences, and troubleshooting code. No AI-generated text was used as final writing; all analytical ideas and essay content are my own. I critically evaluated AI suggestions and integrated them only when they aligned with my rhetorical and ethical goals.</p>
