    <h2>Final Reflective Essay</h2>

    <section class="essay-section">
      <h4>Introduction</h4>

      <p>Throughout this semester in Composing Digital Media, I have learned to see myself not only as a writer or a student, but as a digital composer who works across modalities, genres, and platforms. When I entered the course, I understood digital media mostly as the content I consumed such as gaming trailers, social-media graphics, short-form videos, and the collage-like chaos of the internet. I did not yet understand the rhetorical labor behind it or the ways digital creators intentionally shape audience experience. Over the past several months, through the progression of Project 1, Project 2, and finally Project 3, I have developed a fuller understanding of digital rhetoric, multimodal composition, and my own evolving identity as a digital creator. My central claim is that this course taught me how to translate emotion into design: I learned how to move from analyzing hype, identity, and digital excess to creating work that intentionally communicates those themes. Across all three projects, I began experiencing media not as a passive viewer, but as someone who can look underneath a composition and understand how and why it persuades. That shift, from consumption to creation, is the most meaningful insight I will take away.

      <h4>Metacognitive Journey Across Modalities</h4>

      <p>My metacognitive journey begins with Project 1, a rhetorical analysis of Riot Games’ Born to Burn | Valorant Champions Paris Opening Tease. Before this course, I had watched esports promotional videos hundreds of times without thinking about them rhetorically. I enjoyed the hype, the colors, the music, the emotions, but I had never asked myself why they were so persuasive. Project 1 forced me to become a close observer. I discovered that hype is not accidental; it is built through layers of visual rhetoric, emotional design, and careful storytelling. In the Valorant teaser, Riot uses the symbolic language of love as pain, sacrifice, devotion, and renewal reframes competition as a passionate, almost romantic act. Recognizing that rhetorical strategy helped me understand how digital creators construct narratives that audiences feel rather than consciously analyze.
      </p>
      <p>Writing the analysis helped me develop habits of attention that carried into my later projects. I learned to look for patterns in lighting, color palettes, pacing, translations, transitions, and emotional cues. I also began connecting these findings to concepts we learned from Carroll and McCloud. For example, McCloud’s idea of closure helped me understand why the fast-cut sequences in the teaser felt so immersive. The viewer subconsciously fills in the gaps between moments, creating a continuous emotional arc even when the visuals jump quickly. Similarly, Carroll’s discussion of hierarchy and structure helped me see how the teaser arranged its emotional beats from loss, to revenge, to renewal, to unity, which essentially turned an advertisement into a mini narrative. By breaking down the teaser’s choices, I saw how rhetorical meaning emerges through design, not just through content.
      </p>
      <p>This understanding deeply influenced how I approached Project 2, my visual argument titled Digital Overload. If Project 1 taught me how to analyze digital media, Project 2 required me to create it, and that transition was transformative. I was no longer just evaluating design but producing it. I had to think about color, composition, focal point, balance, and emotional impact. I realized how easily visual arguments can become overwhelming when too many elements compete for attention. In my early drafts, the icons and eyes crowded the composition so heavily that the central figure almost disappeared. It took multiple attempts before I learned how to use lighting and opacity to create hierarchy which directs the viewer’s gaze toward the moment of meaning.
      </p>  
      <p>More importantly, I realized how powerful visual metaphors can be. My collage critiques how digital platforms consume our attention and turn users into performers constantly watched by algorithms and strangers. The blue glow on the subject symbolizes both attraction and exhaustion. The surrounding eyes serve as watchers which represent judgment, surveillance, and the pressure to perform. The fog of floating social-media icons represents noise, overstimulation, and a loss of individuality. Creating these metaphors from scratch required the same rhetorical awareness I practiced in Project 1, but in a new medium. I was no longer interpreting meaning but constructing it intentionally.
      </p>
      <p> What surprised me during Project 2 was how much editing and revision mattered. With writing, I know what revision looks like, but with visual design, revision feels more intuitive and experimental. I would adjust brightness, remove icons, add blur, restructure layers, then undo everything. I discovered how small changes could dramatically affect tone. Lowering the opacity of the background icons, for example, changed a chaotic composition into something that felt overwhelming but still readable. I also learned how important it was to consider the viewer’s emotional response. If the piece looked neutral or too polished, it did not successfully convey anxiety. The goal was not aesthetic perfection but rhetorical intention.
      </p>
      <p>Another layer of my learning this semester was realizing how much digital composition requires emotional self-awareness. When I designed my projects, I wasn’t just arranging visuals or writing analysis, but I was translating my own experiences growing up online. I noticed that the themes I kept returning to, such as overstimulation, hype culture, constant performance, and exhaustion, weren’t random choices. They were reflections of my lived digital reality. This class helped me recognize that digital rhetoric is always autobiographical in some way. Even when the subject is a Valorant trailer or a collage about social media, the emotional perspective behind the work comes from me. Learning to identify and articulate that perspective made me a more intentional creator. I began asking myself: Why does this image feel intense to me? What part of my own experience makes this metaphor resonate? What does my audience already understand because they share that culture with me? Answering these questions helped me see that composing digital media is also composing identity.
      </p>
      <p>So, by the time I reached Project 3, I had to combine everything I had learned: rhetorical analysis (Project 1), emotional visual design (Project 2), and now information architecture, interface design, and coding. Creating the portfolio forced me to think about audience, purpose, identity, and design philosophy at the level of the entire site experience. I wanted the portfolio to feel cohesive with the themes of my earlier projects: digital culture, hype, overstimulation, and self-awareness. I intentionally chose a dark, neon-accented aesthetic inspired by esports visuals and online culture because my intended audience was young adults who live deeply online. I wanted my site to feel like something they recognized: dramatic lighting, glowing edges, bold fonts, and gaming-inspired color palettes.

      <h4>Articulation of Design Philosophy</h4>

      <p>Every design choice had a rhetorical purpose. The dark background reduces visual noise while highlighting bright accents. The cyan and magenta glow effects reference gaming interfaces and Valorant-style aesthetics, connecting visually to my Project 1 analysis. The hero image on the homepage, drawn from my Digital Culture photograph, establishes a mood of intensity and immersion. Smooth transitions and hover animations create a sense of playfulness and polish. The simple navigation structure supports clarity and usability, reflecting Carroll’s emphasis on readable hierarchy. Even the typography (Orbitron for headings and Inter for body text) was chosen to balance futurism with readability.
      </p>
      <p>Creating the web-native version of my essays also helped me understand what it means to compose for a digital public. I could not simply upload a PDF; I had to think about how readers scroll, how images break up text, how section headers guide interpretation, and how digital arguments rely on more than words. Designing the essay pages taught me how to translate academic writing into digital rhetoric and how to maintain analytical rigor while making the reading experience visually engaging. Breaking my long analyses into sections, adding images, and highlighting key rhetorical concepts mirrored the way professional digital publications modernize academic writing for online audiences.
      </p>
      <p>Another component of my design philosophy was making my website accessible through intentional contrast and readability choices. I learned that accessibility is not just a technical requirement, but a rhetorical responsibility as an ethical part of designing for a public audience. I chose a high-contrast palette of deep black backgrounds and bright neon accents because it supports readability for users with low vision and reduces visual strain for readers who may be navigating the site in low-light environments. The bold cyan headings against the dark background create a clear visual hierarchy, and the high contrast between the body text and the page prevents the washed-out effect that often happens with lighter palettes. I also increased spacing, added consistent margins, and used a clean sans-serif body font to improve readability across devices. These choices helped ensure that my portfolio wasn’t just visually striking, but also navigable and inclusive, aligning with Carroll’s emphasis on accessible information architecture and reinforcing my commitment to designing a digital space that considers the needs of all users.

      <h4>Digital Media Tool Integration</h4>

      <p>One of the most significant components of this project was learning to work critically with digital tools, particularly web-authoring tools and AI. This class asked me not only to use digital tools, but to think about them rhetorically and ethically. I used AI for brainstorming ideas, clarifying my writing, polishing awkward sentences, and troubleshooting HTML/CSS errors. However, I maintained full ownership over my creative decisions, analytical ideas, and writing. AI tools served as collaborators not as creators. Learning to use AI responsibly meant constantly evaluating whether I understood the output, whether it served my rhetorical goals, and whether it aligned with the assignment’s ethical expectations. Just as importantly, I learned to critically assess the limitations and biases of AI: it is confident even when it is wrong, it sometimes overgeneralizes, and it cannot replace the lived perspective behind my projects. This awareness gave me more agency as a digital composer working with powerful tools.
      </p>
      <p>At the same time, building a website through HTML and CSS expanded my technical literacy. I learned how to structure a page, how to manage file paths, and how to fix issues that only showed up after publishing to GitHub Pages. I also discovered how frustrating it can be when something looks perfect locally but breaks online due to case sensitivity or relative paths. Troubleshooting these issues taught me problem-solving skills that I can apply far beyond this class.

      <h4>Conclusion: Looking Forward</h4>

      <p>Reflecting on all three projects together, I can see a clear line of development. In Project 1, I learned to recognize how emotion, narrative, and visual cues construct meaning. In Project 2, I learned to design those emotions myself, crafting metaphors and sensory experiences. In Project 3, I learned how to integrate those lessons into a coherent digital identity through layout, hierarchy, and interactive elements. Across all three, I began to see myself as someone capable of shaping digital environments that communicate emotion, argument, and identity.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, the ethical dimension of digital creation feels increasingly important to me. This course made me realize how easily digital media can overwhelm, manipulate, or mislead. It also showed me how powerful it can be when used with intention. As someone who grew up immersed in the internet culture of gaming, social media, and shared digital humor, I now understand that I am not just shaped by digital media; I am capable of shaping it in return. This realization carries ethical responsibility. Whether I create future projects as a student, designer, or participant in online communities, I want to be conscious of how my work affects others. I want to consider accessibility, emotional impact, clarity, and honesty. This course has taught me that every digital composition has consequences which can be sometimes subtle and sometimes profound.
      </p>
      <p>In conclusion, the most meaningful insight I am taking away from Composing Digital Media is that digital composition is a form of emotional and rhetorical design. It is not just about creating content but about shaping experiences. Throughout Projects 1, 2, and 3, I learned to analyze, create, and integrate multimodal arguments that express who I am and how I understand digital culture. I learned to think critically about tools, audiences, and ethical implications. Most importantly, I discovered a new identity for myself: someone who can take the overwhelming intensity of digital life and turn it into meaningful, intentional, and reflective digital expression.</p>

      <h4>AI Use Statement</h4>
      <p>For this project, I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) as a supplemental tool to support my technical and design workflow. My primary uses of AI were for troubleshooting and clarifying issues in my HTML and CSS, not for generating reflective content or analytical arguments. For example, I used prompts such as: “Why is my hero image creating extra space above the navbar?”, “Help me locate a file-path error in GitHub Pages,” and “Generate three options for a responsive neon hover animation.” When ChatGPT provided code snippets or explanations, I edited them to match the structure of my existing files, rewrote sections to maintain consistency with my design, or used them as conceptual guidance rather than direct implementation. In several cases, I intentionally tested its suggestions by breaking or modifying the code to ensure I understood what each change did. Reflecting on this process, I recognize that AI functioned as a collaborative debugging partner which helped me identify mistakes more efficiently, but did not replace my decision-making or my creative ownership. Using AI required continuous evaluation of accuracy, bias, and applicability, and I integrated only the suggestions that aligned with my rhetorical goals, design aesthetics, and ethical responsibilities as a digital composer.
