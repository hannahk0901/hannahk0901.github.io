  <h2>About Hannah Kim</h2>
  <p>Hi — I’m Hannah Kim, a student at the University of Pittsburgh studying digital media and culture. I spend a lot of time in online spaces like Valorant and YouTube, where humor, aesthetics, and connection blend together. This portfolio captures what it feels like to live in that world — to be energized by digital culture yet constantly wired in.</p>
  <p>Through my projects, I explore how online media shapes emotion, identity, and community. I hope visitors recognize themselves in these pieces and reflect on the tension between loving and being overwhelmed by our screens.</p>
