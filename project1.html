      <h3>Main Argument Summary</h3>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>On September 12, 2025, Riot Games released Born to Burn | Valorant Champions Paris
Opening Tease to promote the VALORANT Champions tournament in Paris. At first glance, the
video might appear to be a typical esports hype trailer, filled with shots of players and crowds
designed to generate excitement. Yet closer attention reveals a more ambitious intent. In under
eight minutes, Riot manages to tell a story not only about a tournament but also about the
emotional experiences of players, fans, and communities around the world. The teaser uses Paris,
often known as the “city of love,” as both a literal host city and a symbolic stage. With this
symbolism, the video reframes competition not simply as combat but as a passionate act of love
for the game, for their team, and for the struggles itself. This rhetorical shift is significant. Rather
than leaning on warlike metaphors, as many competitive esports promotions do, Born to Burn
builds a narrative that emphasizes the language of intimacy, sacrifice, and connection. By doing
so, Riot transforms the tournament into a cultural event that bridges countries together. Born to
Burn uses the metaphor of love reinforced through multilingual dialogue, evocative imagery, and
emotional appeals to persuade their audience that VALORANT Champions Paris is not just an
esports tournament but a communal act of passion and belonging. Through organizing its
narrative around defeat, revenge, and brotherhood, and renewal, the teaser positions the
championship as a global fiery challenge of endurance and love for the game.</p>

    <h4>Love as Visual Rhetoric</h4>
    <p>The most striking rhetorical device in the teaser is its framing of love through its visual
and textual imaging. Early in the video, a character is shot during gameplay. Instead of focusing
on the violence as many other teasers do, the frame slows, and the words “tomber amoureux”,
the French word for “fall in love,” appear on the screen (Riot Games). This juxtaposition is
deliberately placed as the audience would normally expect bloodshed to be framed as brutality.
Instead, Riot casts it as intimacy. The message is clear: to compete in VALORANT is to fall in
love with the game, even if it means facing pain and hardship. The question that lingers in the
audience’s mind is,
“What does it mean to fall in love with the game?”</p>

    <p>The teaser moves on to answering that question by continuing in narration saying,
“Defeat after defeat, loss after loss, but now it’s our turn (Riot Games).” Here, love is depicted
as enduring hardship, persisting through repeated heartbreak. The visuals support this point with
flashbacks to gameplay highlights and past defeats, showing beloved players at their lowest
moments only to rise again. By pairing failure with love, Riot suggests that perseverance is a
form of devotion and that to truly love something means to accept the pain as a foreshadowing of
joy. To fall in love with the game is to devote your life to it through the moments of hardship.
The video then transitions by accompanying the phrase “sometimes we kill for love” with a
VALORANT agent firing a weapon (Riot Games). The camera then cuts immediately to a
museum in Paris, where teams walk past grand paintings. The rhetorical effect is layered, as in
the first level, Riot equates the in-game gunplay with the passion of love. On the next level, by
transitioning directly into the museum, Riot positions esports as part of the cultural sphere of art,
displaying that VALORANT is not just for entertainment but also an artistic performance worthy
of reverence.</p>

    <h4>New Beginnings and Regeneration</h4>
    <p>After the museum scenes, soft visuals of blooming petals and green grass appear. The
narration states: “Love blooms with new beginnings (Riot Games).” This moment presents a
sharp contrast to the earlier flames and gunfire. Where fire was destructive, flowers are
regenerative. The rhetorical point is that esports, like love, is cyclical. The roster changes,
players come and go, but new journeys are always around the corner. Love survives, and so does
the competitive spirit. While there may be moments when their passion wanes, their love for the
game will reignite its spirit, blossoming into another adventure in the game. The closing montage
ties all these images together. The crowds roar, gameplay flashes across the screen, and the Eiffel
Tower rises against the Paris skyline. Love, initially depicted as painful, is finally revealed as a
communal fire of passion.</p>

    <h4>Architecture of Love</h4>
    <p>Brian Carroll emphasizes that clarity, hierarchy, and the design of information structures
shape how audiences move through and make sense of content (Writing and Editing for Digital
Media, Ch. 4). In a digital teaser like this, the architecture is temporal rather than spatial. The
audience experiences it sequentially, watching words, sounds, and images unfold one after
another. The order of images, phrases, and scenes creates a narrative arc. Born to Burn follows a
carefully constructed sequence that mirrors stages of love. The five stages that Riot uses is loss,
revenge, new beginnings, brotherhood, and a shared fire.</p>

    <ul class="stages">
      <li><strong>Loss and Sacrifice:</strong> The first stage is loss and sacrifice. The opening lines about defeat and loss, paired with
“tomber amoureux”, frame love as painful devotion, situating players and fans alike within a
cycle of heartbreak (Riot Games). To love the game is to sacrifice what you have to achieve the
dreams of winning and making a name for yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>Revenge and Resolution:</strong> The second stage is revenge and resolution. In the museum, the narration speaks of
revenge and giving no mercy. Love is no longer passive endurance but a fierce commitment to
reclaiming pride. Love is a continuous choice to commit, and in a way, revenge is a strong way
of showing that commitment to the game. The juxtaposition of fine art with competitive violence
suggests that revenge, too, has its own artistry.</li>
      <li><strong>New Beginnings:</strong> The third stage is new beginnings. The field of flowers represents regeneration. The
narration about roster changes, such as players leaving and joining, frames love as ever-
renewing. Teams may evolve, doubts may come into play, but in the end, the passion endures.</li>
      <li><strong>Brotherhood:</strong> The fourth stage is brotherhood. After the flower field scene, Riot introduces a café scene
in Paris, showing Korean players sitting together and talking. An older teammate tells a younger
one that he is the future of the team. They reminisce about the bond that they have formed as the
narration states: “It turns strangers into brothers (Riot Games).” Here, love is framed as
mentorship, trust, and family.</li>
      <li><strong>Shared Fire:</strong> The final stage is shared fire. A French voiceover declares, “It unites a single ember into
a shared fire.” This metaphor brings the arc to completion. Love, once experienced in isolation,
becomes collective. When the announcer finally declares, “Sixteen of the best teams have
arrived here in Paris (Riot Games),” the audience sees not only competition but also a global
communion. This architecture persuades by leading viewers through an emotional journey. By
the time the montage of players and gameplay appears, audiences are primed to see Champions
Paris not just as matches but as the culmination of love’s many forms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Affordances and Audience Participation</h4>
    <p>While the teaser itself does not allow the viewer to click or navigate, its design builds
affordances that encourage audience participation. One is multilingual narration and subtitles.
For example, when the French phrase “tomber amoureux” appears, the English subtitle “Born to
Burn” appears alongside it (Riot Games). Also, when players from other countries speak in other
languages, such as Chinese and Korean, subtitles are made available. This linguistic diversity
underscores the tournament's international character. For native speakers, the phrases carry
immediate resonance; for others, subtitles foster intrigue and inclusion. The multilingual design
rhetorically invites global audiences to identify with the story.</p>

    <p>Another affordance is immersive cinematography. Flashbacks of gameplay remind
audiences of real matches, letting fans relive collective memories. POV-like shots and close-ups
of players evoke immersion, as if the viewer is sitting alongside the professionals. This style
allows fans to imagine themselves within the narrative, not merely outside it. Finally, the teaser
leverages platform affordances. Released on YouTube and social media, the video is designed to
be shared, commented on, and remixed. Its unfinished narrative, hinting at stories of revenge,
renewal, and unity without resolution, creates a gap that only the live tournament can fill. This
rhetorical choice demands that audiences tune in, thus ensuring participation beyond the teaser
itself.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="essay-section">
    <h4>Ethos, Pathos, and Logos</h4>
    <p>The persuasive force of the teaser rests on the classical appeals of ethos, pathos, and
logos. Ethos emerges through Riot’s credibility as the game’s developer and tournament
organizer. By placing the championship in Paris, a city synonymous with romance and culture,
the video borrows ethos from the location itself. Shots of museums and the Eiffel Tower lend
prestige, aligning esports with cultural legitimacy. Pathos dominates the teaser. Emotional
appeals are apparent in every frame, from the anguish of defeat to the joy of brotherhood.
Phrases like “sometimes we kill for love” and “love blooms with new beginnings” tap into
universal human emotions, transforming competition into something audiences can feel in their
own lives (Riot Games). The swelling music, crowd chants, and montage editing amplify this
pathos, ensuring that viewers leave with their hearts racing. Logos operates more subtly. The
announcer’s line “16 of the best teams have arrived here in Paris”, provides the logical stakes:
the world’s top teams are converging, and only one will win. The logical structure of competition
supports the emotional appeals. Together, these appeals persuade audiences that Champions
Paris is credible, emotionally significant, and logically essential to watch.</p>

  <section class="essay-section">
    <h4>Cultural Impact and Ethical Tension</h4>
    <p>The cultural impact of Born to Burn lies in its redefinition of esports. By framing
competition as love, Riot elevates gaming into a ritual of passion and belonging. This rhetorical
move reflects several broader cultural dynamics. First, it showcases the globalization of esports.
Teams from Korea, China, Europe, and the Americas are all represented, and the multilingual
narration emphasizes inclusivity. Esports here become a shared ritual that transcends borders.
Second, it dramatizes the ideology of sacrifice. The notion of being “born to burn” implies that
greatness requires suffering. While this is inspiring, it also risks glamorizing burnout, a known
issue in professional gaming. The rhetoric simultaneously motivates and masks the costs of high-
level competition. Third, it reveals that while love is authentic, it is also branded to be consumed
by the fans. Fans are encouraged to buy into these narratives not only emotionally but also
commercially, through merchandise, viewership, and digital items. Finally, it contributes to the
legitimization of esports as mainstream culture. By situating its story in Paris, a city associated
with art and romance, Riot argues implicitly that esports belong on the same stage as traditional
cultural spectacles like the Olympics or World Cup.</p>

  <section class="essay-section">
    <h4>Conclusion: To Burn Together</h4>
    <p>Born to Burn | VALORANT Champions Paris Opening Tease is more than a promotional
video. It is a carefully constructed piece of digital rhetoric that reframes competition as love.
Through the metaphor of love, Riot persuades audiences that Champions Paris is not just about
winning games but about experiencing passion, community, and shared fire. The teaser succeeds
because it appeals simultaneously to ethos, pathos, and logos, while embedding those appeals in
a narrative architecture that moves from loss to renewal to unity. Its ethical implications,
however, are complex. By glorifying sacrifice, the video risks normalizing burnout, and by
commodifying love, it blurs the line between authentic passion and marketable product. Yet
these very tensions make the teaser culturally significant. It reflects how digital rhetoric in the
age of esports can transform play into ritual, competition into identity, and a corporate
tournament into a global narrative of belonging. To love VALORANT, the teaser suggests, is to
be willing to endure defeat, to seek revenge, to form brotherhood, and to burn together. In Paris,
the city of love, Riot proclaims that this love will ignite the world.</p>
