      <h3>Designer Statement</h3>
      <p>My visual argument, Digital Overload, critiques how social media has transformed
connection into consumption. It argues that users are not only constantly watched by digital
platforms, but also conditioned to seek validation through endless scrolling and notification
loops. The composition centers on a person illuminated by the harsh blue glow of a phone
screen. That glow represents both attraction and entrapment highlighting that addictive light that
keeps us staring even when we know it’s draining us. Surrounding the figure are scattered eyes,
symbols of surveillance, judgment, and others who are similarly addicted. Each one mirrors the
feeling of being observed online, even in supposed solitude. Behind it all, familiar icons from
Instagram, Facebook, and other platforms blur into a chaotic fog that erases individuality. One of
my biggest challenges was getting that chaos to feel intentional. My early drafts were too
cluttered as I had too many icons, too many eyes, and too much noise. The composition looked
overwhelming, but not in the purposeful way I wanted. The viewer didn’t know where to look,
and that confusion weakened the argument. What fixed it was how I reworked the light. I made
the phone and person the brightest point in the piece and darkened everything else around it as I
expanded outwards. That glow instantly draws the eye to the center and symbolizes how screens
dominate our focus. I also made the icons more transparent by lowering the opacity so that they
could be chaotic without overtaking the scene. Once I found that balance, the image felt
overwhelming but controlled.I chose a cold blue color palette to emphasize emotional
detachment. The layered opacity of icons and eyes creates visual noise that mirrors the constant
flood of notifications and content we face every day. The central figure’s exhaustion captures the
hidden emotional cost of our digital lives. Overall, making my piece made me think more
critically about design as communication. I realized that creating digital media isn’t just about
making something look polished, but it’s about directing emotion and attention.</p>

      <h3>Reflection: <em>Digital Overload</em></h3>
      <p><em>Digital Overload</em> explores the psychological and emotional consequences of social media consumption. The core argument is that digital platforms designed to connect us have instead learned to manipulate and consume our attention. Through the metaphor of surveillance and control, the piece suggests that users are both the watchers and the watched—trapped in cycles of validation, distraction, and dependency.</p>

      <p>My visual argument, Digital Overload, explores the psychological and emotional
consequences of social media consumption. The core argument is that the digital platforms
designed to connect us have instead learned to manipulate and consume our attention. Through
the visual metaphor of surveillance and control, the piece suggests that users are both the
watchers and the watched, trapped in a cycle of validation, distraction, and dependency. My
target audience is primarily young adults and college students, a generation that has grown up
immersed in technology and is intimately familiar with the feeling of always being online. The
purpose of this composition is to critique the culture of constant connectivity and to persuade
viewers to pause and reflect on how much control social media truly holds over their daily lives.</p>
      <p>I wanted the image to produce discomfort rather than neutrality. I didn’t want it to look
like a poster about digital wellness. Instead, I wanted it to feel invasive, to mirror the anxious
energy of being flooded with notifications and watched by unseen algorithms. The piece operates
as a visual warning, not by moralizing, but by showing the power imbalance between human
users and digital systems. Ultimately, the argument is not that technology is evil, but that our
relationship with it has become parasitic: what once served us now feeds on us.</p>
      <p>The rhetorical choices I made were to communicate through immediate, emotional
impact rather than explanation. I thought making a visual image instead of an audio would be
best in making an immediate impact. The overstimulation of digital life is primarily a sensory
experience of screens, lights, pings, and endless scrolling, so it made sense to represent that
through image rather than words. I began with a dark color palette dominated by deep blues and
blacks to evoke the artificial glow of a screen in a dark room. The central figure, lit only by their
phone, represents how absorbed we become by our devices, both physically and psychologically. The light on the face is cold and isolating, rather than warm or inviting, to suggest that the
connection technology promises is ultimately hollow. The word CONSUME arches above the
person’s head as both a title and a command. Its placement gives it the shape of a halo or a brand,
symbolizing how consumption has become sanctified in digital culture. The surrounding eyes
represent the surveillance inherent to online life: advertisers, algorithms, and other users are
always watching. I wanted them to feel omnipresent, part human, part machine, floating in the
dark like manifestations of invisible attention. Behind these elements, the logos of popular social
media fog up the image, just how it fogs up our minds. By visually layering these symbols, I
aimed to create a sense of digital claustrophobia. Everything in the composition converges
toward the glowing rectangle of the phone, the brightest point in the image. That central glow
functions as a visual metaphor for addiction as it captures attention completely, leaving the rest
of the surroundings dim.</p>
      <p>My process began with brainstorming different metaphors for digital overstimulation. I
sketched several ideas in Procreate that involved screens replacing faces with tangled cords
representing social networks. Eventually, I settled on the motif of the watcher and the watched,
which led to the idea of surrounding the viewer with eyes and notifications. I used Procreate’s
layering and blending tools to assemble the composition, experimenting with different brush
textures and opacity settings to make the lighting look realistic. The most difficult part of the
process was balancing clutter with clarity. Early drafts looked too visually noisy, which made it
hard for viewers to focus on the argument. I was able to reduce the noise by changing the opacity
of the background which also recentered the focus to the man in the center. It was also nice to
hear feedback from fellow peers during our draft day as I felt encouraged in the direction I took. </p>
      <p>I used Procreate on an iPad for the design because it allowed me to draw and edit freely
with precise control. The software gave me flexibility to blend photographic elements with
hand-drawn textures and to use lighting brushes to create the phone’s blue glow. The easiest part
of the process was sketching and layering elements since the interface is intuitive and supports
pressure-sensitive drawing. The most challenging part was achieving a cohesive color balance, as
Procreate’s lighting effects can easily overpower the composition if overused. I learned how to
adjust hue, saturation, and Gaussian blur to create depth without flattening the image.</p>
      <p>Overall, Digital Overload taught me that visual rhetoric is not just about aesthetic
arrangement but about emotional persuasion. Every light, shadow, and layer of text shapes how
the viewer feels and interprets meaning. By building this piece in Procreate, I discovered that
visual design and rhetorical strategy are inseparable. The tools we use to create are also the tools
we use to argue.</p>

      <h3>AI Use Statement</h3>
      <p>I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) during the initial brainstorming stage of this project. I asked the model to help me think through different thematic approaches to understanding how digital technology shapes daily life. The ideas generated included themes such as attention economy, digital identity, and emotional effects of online culture.</p>

      <p>No text, visuals, or design elements from ChatGPT were directly used in my final composition. All writing, visual design, and production decisions are my own. The AI’s role was limited to early-stage ideation and concept clarification, and I critically evaluated all suggestions before incorporating any conceptual direction into the project.</p>
